Prism: An Algorithm-Driven Social Media App

Description:
The Algorithm-Driven Social Media App is a modern, interactive platform designed for seamless user engagement. This application utilizes an intelligent algorithm to curate personalized content, ensuring a dynamic and engaging user experience.
The app's algorithm is designed to personalize each user's feed based on their liked posts, ensuring they see content that aligns with their interests and engagement history. Additionally, the platform features a Top Trending Posts section that highlights the most liked posts across all users, allowing for the discovery of popular and viral content. This balance of personalization and trending insights creates a highly engaging and socially connected experience for users.
Users can communicate by commenting on posts, fostering discussions and interactions within the community. Additionally, they have the option to like or dislike posts, further refining their personalized feed and contributing to the platform's trending algorithm.
Users can create posts containing text, pictures, and videos, allowing for diverse content sharing. Hashtags can be used to increase visibility and help posts trend within the platform, boosting engagement and discoverability.
